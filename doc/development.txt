If you're interested in how wad2image works or in contributing to it this
document may be helpful.

wad2image is a Python program that should work on most systems with a
reasonably recent version of Pillow installed. It uses Devin Acker's fork of
Omgifol, which is bundled in third-party/omg.

To submit a change to wad2image fork it and send a pull request. It's github
page is https://github.com/selliott512/wad2image . If it's a lot of work and
you'd like to discuss it first you can reach me at selliott512@gmail.com

The organization and style of wad2image should be clear, but here are a few
highlights that apply to bin/wad2image.py:
1) Code is indented 4 spaces (no tabs).
2) Methods and variable names are lower case with underscores ("_").
3) It's divided into three sections:
    // Globals
    // Functions
    // Main entry
4) The functions are in alphabetical order.
5) The long version of command line options are in alphabetical order.

TODO: Add more information about how wad2image works. For now hopefully the
comments will be helpful.
