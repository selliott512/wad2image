There are people who helped with wad2image that I'd like to thank.

* A big thanks to the Omgifol project, and particularly drawmaps.py, which
  this program is based on.

* As far as I know the idea of using animated GIF files to illustrate
  differences between revisions of a map originated from Linguica at DoomWorld.
  Here's an example of such GIFs he created manually:

  wad2image automates creating such GIFs.

* And last but not least my partner Erikalin Ashton who helped me test
  wad2image and gave me feedback on it.
