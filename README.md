wad2image
=========

An open source command line utility for converting maps in Doom WAD files to
images. There are many options to control how the images are created.
wad2image can select multiple maps from multiple WAD files and create images
for those maps. wad2image can create animated GIFs to illustrate the
differences between revisions of a map.
