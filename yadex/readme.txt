These Yadex Game Definitions files were copied from Yadex version 1.7.0. They
provide a means of cross referencing Doom types (numeric IDs) to characteristics
of that type. For example, the "thing" section relates the thing type to the
sprite name, which wad2image uses to render things. Both these files as well as
wad2image are covered by GPLv2 or later.
